<p><img alt="Sanatorium Live" title="Sanatorium Live" src="/uploads/attachment/sanatorium_live.jpg" />After 7 years from the last gig on Peace Unlimited Festival, Sanatorium 
    will play live on the moto-fest organized by "Night wolves". The event 
    will happen on Kale Fortress in Skopje at 11th of June 2011. 
    Unfortunately, Konstantin Kachev - Rus will not be able to play because 
    of his art installation in Germany in that period, and Boban Vasileski 
    will be his replacement.
