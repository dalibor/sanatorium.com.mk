They took the stage at 9pm and in those moments was thrown fireworks, a few sparkling high fire areas. Then loud applause was following and crowd was screaming "Sanatorium" and "Ultra Speed".</p><p>9.15pm The smoke covered the scene, and Sanatorium hit the stage with song "Grad". The crowd moves on all sides and sing in one voice. "Grad" turns into "Epidemic Of Hate" and then follows "Wasted Existence", "Illusion Of Mind Confusion", "Sekoj Deny", "No More Patience", "Live In Silence" during which the audience totally torn mad after each song screaming "Ultra Speed, Ultra Speed, Ultra Speed ...". Crni was asking "What song?" To which all responded with one voice "ULTRA SPEED". Crni takes off his shirt and song "Ultra Speed" was played with Crni and Rus on vocals. At the forefront of the audience gets in on all sides, and some of them are thrown to the stage. Then follows the well-known "Vo Sebe Umiram," "Bez Razum I Svest" and "Our Doom" and Sanatorium closed their performance.</p>
