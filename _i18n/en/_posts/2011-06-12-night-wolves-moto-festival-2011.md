<p><img alt="Sanatorium at Night Wolves 2011 festival" title="Sanatorium at Night Wolves 2011 festival" src="/uploads/attachment/sanatorium_kale.jpg" />Sanatorium performance at Night Wolves Moto Festival yesterday was a 
    real blast! Atmosphere was crazy from the beginning and the band played 
    about 90-minutes long show. Some really old songs were played from the 
    album "The Edge Of Sanity" that we haven't heard for a while. You can 
    see some photos taken by</p><p><a title="Night Wolves 2011 (Dnevnik)" href="/galleries/nokjni_volci_2011_dnevnik">Emilija Manevska / Dnevnik</a><br />

    Senka na smrtta<br />Wasted existence<br />Grad
