<p>At Saturday, 16th March 2002, two members from Sanatorium (Shpirt and 
Crni) went to Kocani to present their material, chat and have fun with 
their fans. The promotion took place at the B&amp;G pub, where a lot of 
people gathered. The guys from Sanatorium gave interviews for the local 
TV and radio station. And the night, Sanatorium gave the crowd some 
metal by rocking some great tunes like ACDC, Metallica, Sepultura, etc.</p>
